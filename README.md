# Employee Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a small, foundational **Employee Management System** built using the **Spring MVC** framework. It demonstrates a complete web application flow, covering CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employee records within a single application context. The system is configured entirely using **Java Configuration**, eliminating the need for traditional `web.xml` and other XML configuration files. It leverages **Hibernate** for robust ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) with an **H2 in-memory database** for quick setup and seamless development. The frontend is powered by **JSP (JavaServer Pages)** for dynamic content rendering, styled with plain HTML and CSS to provide a user-friendly interface.

The system allows users to:
* View a list of all employees.
* Add new employees.
* Edit existing employee details.
* Delete employee records.

## Features and Functionality

This system provides a comprehensive set of features for managing employee records, focusing on ease of use and efficient data handling:

* **Employee Data Management (CRUD Operations):**
    * **View Employee List:** Displays a clear, tabular overview of all registered employees, including their unique ID, Name, Department, and Email. Each entry provides direct links for editing or deleting the record, as seen in the application's main view.

    * **Add New Employee:** Offers a dedicated form to easily input details for a new employee, such as their name, department, and email address, which are then saved to the database.

    * **Edit Employee Details:** Provides functionality to modify the information of an existing employee. Users can select an employee from the list, update their details via a form, and save the changes.

    * **Delete Employee Record:** Allows for the permanent removal of an employee record from the system. Before deletion, an alert box will be displayed to confirm the user's action, ensuring data cleanliness and accurate employee tracking.

* **Robust Data Persistence:**
    * Utilizes **Hibernate ORM** to seamlessly map Java objects (like `Employee` entities) to the relational database, simplifying data storage and retrieval.
    * Employs an **H2 Database** in an in-memory mode, providing a fast, lightweight, and self-contained database solution ideal for development and testing, as no external database server installation is required.

* **Modular Application Architecture:**
    * Built on **Spring MVC**, ensuring a well-organized Model-View-Controller pattern that separates application logic, presentation, and data handling, promoting maintainability and scalability within a monolithic application.

* **Simplified Configuration & Development:**
    * Features **Java Configuration** throughout, meaning all Spring and Hibernate setups are defined in Java classes, moving away from verbose XML files (`web.xml`, `spring-servlet.xml`).

* **Interactive User Interface:**
    * The frontend is developed using **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**, enabling dynamic content generation and seamless data display.
    * Styled with **HTML and Custom CSS** to provide a clean, user-friendly interface for managing employee records.

## Technologies Used

* **Java:** JDK 8 or higher
* **Spring Framework:** 5.x (Spring MVC, Spring Context, Spring ORM)
* **Hibernate:** 5.x (Core, Entity Manager)
* **H2 Database:** Latest stable version
* **Apache Maven:** For project build automation and dependency management
* **Apache Tomcat:** 9.x or higher (Servlet Container)
* **JSP (JavaServer Pages):** For frontend views
* **JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library)::** For common JSP functionalities
* **HTML & CSS:** For structuring and styling the web pages

## Database Schema

The H2 database instance will manage its schema based on the Hibernate entity mapping.

### Employee Table

The `employee` table stores details of employees in the system.
* **`id`**: Primary key (auto-generated by the database).
* **`name`**: Name of the employee.
* **`department`**: Employee's department.
* **`email`**: Employee's contact email.

## Key UI Pages / Example Operations

The application is accessed via standard web URLs, with interactions typically driven by navigating links and submitting forms.

* **Accessing the Employee List:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    `http://localhost:8080/employee-management-system/hello`
    (Replace `8080` with your Tomcat port if different, and `employee-management-system` with your application's context path). This will display the main list of employees.

* **Adding a New Employee:**
    From the main employee list page, look for an "Add Employee" link or button. Clicking this will take you to a form where you can enter the details for a new employee. Upon submission, the new employee will be saved to the database and added to the list.

## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to get the Spring MVC application up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher installed and configured.
* **Apache Maven:** Installed and configured in your system's PATH.
* **Apache Tomcat:** Version 9.x or higher downloaded and set up.
* **IDE:** An IDE like Eclipse (with Spring Tools Suite plugin) or IntelliJ IDEA.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

(Assuming your project is in a Git repository. If not, adapt this step accordingly.)

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-system.git](https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-system.git)
cd employee-management-system # Navigate into the project root directory
```
### Step 2: Open in Your IDE

Navigate to the project directory and open it in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse with Spring Tools Suite). The IDE should recognize it as a Maven project.

* **Eclipse:**
    1.  Open Eclipse.
    2.  Go to the top menu bar, click `File` > `Import...`.
    3.  In the "Import" wizard, expand `Maven` and select `Existing Maven Projects`. Click `Next`.
    4.  Click the `Browse...` button next to "Root Directory" and navigate to the root directory of the cloned project (where `pom.xml` is located).
    5.  Once selected, the projects found in that directory (your `employee-management-system`) will be listed. Ensure it's checked.
    6.  Click `Finish`. Eclipse will then import the Maven project, download dependencies, and build the workspace.

* **IntelliJ IDEA:**
    1.  Open IntelliJ IDEA.
    2.  From the welcome screen or the top menu bar, click `File` > `Open...`.
    3.  Navigate to the root directory of the cloned project (the folder containing `pom.xml`).
    4.  Select the `pom.xml` file itself or the project's root folder and click `Open`.
    5.  IntelliJ IDEA will typically detect it as a Maven project and ask if you want to import it. Confirm to import the project as a Maven project.
    6.  The IDE will then proceed to download all necessary Maven dependencies and index the project. This might take a few moments depending on your internet connection and the number of dependencies.


### Step 3: Setup Dependencies

The project uses Maven for dependency management. Ensure your IDE has Maven properly configured. You can also run `mvn clean install` from the root directory to download all necessary dependencies and build the project's WAR file.

### Step 4: Run the Application on Tomcat

1.  **Clean and Build Project:**
    From your project's root directory in a terminal, run:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
    This command compiles your code, runs tests, and packages your application into a `.war` file (e.g., `employee-management-system.war`) located in the `target/` directory.

2.  **Deploy to Tomcat:**
    * **Manual Deployment:** Copy the generated `.war` file from `target/` to Tomcat's `webapps/` directory.
    * **IDE Deployment:** Configure your IDE to run the application on Tomcat. This is the recommended approach as it simplifies starting and stopping.
        * **Eclipse:** In the "Servers" view, add a new Tomcat server, then add your project to it.
        * **IntelliJ IDEA:** Create a new Tomcat Run/Debug Configuration and deploy your artifact.

3.  **Start Tomcat:**
    Ensure your Apache Tomcat server is running. If you're using an IDE, start the server from within the IDE's "Servers" view. **You can now use the application by navigating to the application's URL in your web browser.**
